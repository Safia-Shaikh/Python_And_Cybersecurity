# SHAPEAI Python and Cybersecurity BOOTCAMP Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by &lt;b> SHAPEAI &lt;/b>. The instructor during the session was Mr. Harsh Akshit (Student Lead at Google). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. &lt;br>&lt;br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well&lt;br> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zl8TDRnbulLetcbkthT0p_IzwgRAYbu"> &lt;img src="https://github.com/ShapeAI/PYTHON-AND-CYBERSECURITY/blob/main/YOUTUBE%20THUMBNAIL-4.png"> &lt;/a> &lt;br>I got to have hands on experience on: &lt;li>Python &lt;li>Selenium for web automation &lt;li>SQL Injection &lt;li>Solving Capture the flag on hacker101 &lt;li>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration testing[VAPT] &lt;br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
